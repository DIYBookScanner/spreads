General
=======
- Clean up GUI code, it's an unholy mess...
- Refactor tests, they need work on several levels:
    * more specific: what should a method *do*/*effects*
    * less mock objects
    * better coverage
- Reinstate 'combine' plugin as a custom subcommand that expects 'odd' and
  'even' directories in project path

Plugin ideas
============
- CBR (rar) plugin
- Metadata plugin using OpenLibrary for ISBN-queries and Dublin Core for
  serialization
- Archive.org upload plugin
